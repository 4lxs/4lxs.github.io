  a tool used for predicting a target variable given feature variables assuming
  the relationship between target and feature variables is linear

# Linear Regression

## Assumption

assumption of linearity means that the expected value of the target can be expressed as a weighted sum of it's features

$$
y = wX + b
$$

## Reality

even if the best model for predicting y given x is linear, we would not expect any real world dataset where  due to measurement errors and the like, there will generally be some error
