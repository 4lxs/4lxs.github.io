# Haskell

## learning

to learn the language, i recommend

* [cis194](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html)
* [real world haskell](https://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/)
* [learn you a haskell](https://learnyouahaskell.github.io)

you can do a couple exercises

* [99 haskell problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)
* [exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/haskell/exercises)
* [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/)

after you get bored with that, you can try following a project

* [write yourself a scheme in 48 hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours/Evaluation,_Part_1)

    i recommend using megaparsec instead of parsec for an additional challenge
    with [this tutorial](https://markkarpov.com/tutorial/megaparsec.html)

* [write yourself a scheme v2](https://wespiser.com/writings/wyas/home.html)

    modernized version. recommend going through this after original as it's a
    bit more advanced.
