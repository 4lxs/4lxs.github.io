### [Why Functional Programming Matters](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf)

- presents benefits of lazy evaluation and composition of functions
- examples seem a bit contrived, but perhaps it's just because i'm not familiar
with the formulas and to mathematicians these are more natural. I didn't bother
reasoning through them, because I knew where it was going and what it was trying
to say
- overall, a good read. you won't get much out of it if you're already a
seasoned functional programmer[^1], but may provide the aha moment for someone
coming from other paradigms

[^1]: though you can still read it as it's considered a classic
