# Learning

notetaking:

- set up **cornell notetaking method** (two lines)
- morse code method
- QEC method

top down method

parreto principle (80/20 rule): 80% of results come from 20% of the causes
stare at who you want to become [1: #1](https://danielcoyle.com/little-book-talent/)
pay attention immediately after you make a mistake: don't pretend like it didn't
happen. what can you do next to improve? refs: [1: #22](https://danielcoyle.com/little-book-talent/)

visualisation for performance

cheat sheet: why do i need to memorize these facts. if i truly umderstood the
subject, would i still need to memorize them?

moore. weakest student questions

## understand deeply

- master the fundementals (constantly revisit the basic concepts in the subject)
- ask what you know: write a detailed list of fundementals. do you really
  understand them?
- can you teach it to someone else? (**feynman technique**)

problem you can't solve:

- break it down into smaller pieces that you can solve (**chunking**)
- find an easier problem that you can solve
- ask questions
- be your own socrates
- are there hidden assumptions, bias, vagueness, errors
- when you don't know something, you want to know that you don't know as soon as
  possible
- question everything and everyone around you
- ask what if... (see if you can go deeper)
- look at it from another perspective. ask what if this were false

## fail, and fail hard

make an attempt, find one thing wrong with it, fix that thing, repeat
ask whether the mistake is the answer to another question

## study (info gathering)

- should be 90 minutes total

### before

- binatural beats 5 mins [yt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_G60OdEzXs)
  - look at a point. refocus your attention when it wanders
  - [cyclic hyperventilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIVz7zynQP8)

### during

- white/pink noise while studying

- prime yourself for study (**priming effect**)
  - solve a couple problems or answer some questions from previous sessions on
    this subject
- skim
  - read the first paragraph, the headings and first sentences of later
    paragraphs and sections, look at images, read the introduction/conclusion if
    there are any, read a couple sentences before/after keywords
  - goal is to learn about the ideas and structure of their development
  - determine some questions (from chapter headings, end of chapter questions,
    reading objectives)
- select what you're going to read. do you need to read all sections?

- read in sections (~20mins at a time)
- ask questions
  - why is an explicitly stated fact or concept is true (**Elaborative interrogation**)
  - be precise
  - be frequent
  - how is new information is related to known information, or explaining steps
    taken during problem solving (**Self-explanation**)
    > [!important] Todo: which questions to ask?
- Attempting to form mental images of text materials while reading or listening
  - some material may not allow it (only useful when you can generate images)
- take notes on paper
  - write down questions that you think a professor would put on the test
- keep in mind the questions you got in the [[#before]] section
- **RAP** method:
  - read a paragraph or a section
  - ask questions about what you just read (min 3)
  - put answers into your own words
- summarise the material in your own words (with only the toc as help)
- [[#understand deeply]]

- go over notes and transfer them to vault
  - transform the content in some way
  - tie it into the existing information
  - minimize it (ask if it's really important to store it)
  - make mental images (if possible)
  - try to answer the questions you wrote and then scan for it
- find exercises for the material

### after

- meditation or nsdr after study
- track habit

## practice (info retention)

- Spread out sessions as much as possible (for some material) (Distributed practice)
  - 10-20% of desired retention interval
- mix different kinds of problems within a single study session (Interleaved practice)
- even if you don't know [[#fail, and fail hard]]

## practice (skill acquisition)

set goals for the session (**SMART**)

- hard, but not too hard: you should get to the edge of your abilities
