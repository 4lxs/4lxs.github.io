# smart goals and habits

resonate with [buffet's 20 slots][20-slots]. go "all in" on a single skill/goal.
for me, that will be programming

4 \* 90 minute slots per day for deliberate practice

## smart goals

specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound

finish "crafting interpreters" book and have a working interpreter by 2024-08-31

- start: 2024-07-28
- it's about .7 chapters per day, so it's achievable
- planned min 1 time slot per day
- finish with a blog post

do 2 codeforces problems with rating 2000 in a 90 minute slot consistently
(multiple times in a row) by 2024-08-31

- start: 2024-07-28
- hard to say if it's achievable. depends on how fast i can improve
- planned min 1 time slot per day + 1 problem outside slots if slot is study only

complete 4 intermediate projects with rust by 2024-08-31

- start: 2024-07-28
- 1 project every week with some buffer
- min 1 time slot per day

## habits

- read either a research paper or 20 pages of a book every day before bed
- 4 deliberate practice sessions of 90 minutes every day
- meditate 15 minutes every day
- defocus periods
- work on side projects every day
- [physiological sigh] 5 minutes every day to reduce stress

- [cyclic hyperventilation] to temporarily increase focus and alertness

idea: remind yourself of the goals multiple times a day to keep them in mind
[goals-above-all-else]

## deliberate practice

- identify the expert performers in your field
- figure out what they do that makes them so good
- find out what do you need to improve to achieve those goals
- design purposeful practice around learning how to do that yourself
  set duration

- work expands to fill the time available for its completion (**parkinsons law**)
