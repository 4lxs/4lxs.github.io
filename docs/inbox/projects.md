## ideas

## brainstorming

- classification learning for rss feed
- rss reader app
- srr: combined \-arr's with channels
- mms (media management system)
- newsletter to rss (mail server)
- quality book sharing platform through ipfs
  there's a central "library" that for each book has "files" (each pdf is it's own
  file). it also has associated "features" (good toc, scan or distributed...)
- wiki blog platform with repl support. jupyter-like with multiple languages
- text-based mind map generator
- torrent files sorter/importer into audiobookbay/jellyfin
- messaging app based on ssh. have a private/public key pair. nickname on a
  server points to a public key. a user is referenced same as in ssh (user@host)
- minecraft client from scratch (from opengl) - game engine
  should implement the original minecraft protocol and be able to connect to servers
- memory tutorial website
- game where you can rotate the world with scroll (and yet it moves, but in 3d)
