## waterfall any position (kostya kimlat)

- you have a memorized deck
- spectator thinks of a card
- you waterfall and grab the exact card

## coin toss control

- ability to control a coin toss

## unambitious card

spectator picks a card and places it on the table face up. I get pissed cuz the
deck is all the same card, but he chose the one that's different (ruining the
trick). I throw the card away "let's try this again". picks a card face up. this
time the back is different (same trick). "you're obviously a set up"...

trick ends by having the spectator name a random card. open top card (not the
one), open another (again, no). reveal is that all the cards are in new deck
order with the one card missing. "shit. i must've thrown it away. fuck this"
leaves
