# Malware Hell

I made this, so that I don't have to keep 100+ tabs open all the time and to keep them organized for later use

also, note that it's all interconnected and some links fit in multiple categories. I've tried my best to separate them, but it's definitely not perfect.



I am planning on moving ml to another website. this is it's temporary home
